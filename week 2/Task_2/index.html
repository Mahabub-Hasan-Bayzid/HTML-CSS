                "I am Mahbub Hasan Bayzid, a Business Information Technology and Game Development student at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences. With a strong foundation in web development and digital marketing, I’ve worked on various projects, including an e-commerce platform using Laravel and a portfolio website. My career goal is to become a successful full-stack web developer and establish my own IT firm.

Beyond academics, I have hands-on experience in the restaurant industry and digital marketing, which has shaped my problem-solving skills and work ethic. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing football, cricket, or working on creative projects that combine my love for design and technology."
